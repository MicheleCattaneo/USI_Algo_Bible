'''
Consider this minimal vertex cover problem: given a graph G = (V, E), find a minimal
set of vertices S such that for every edge (u, v) âˆˆ E, u or v (or both) are in S.
Question 1: Model minimal vertex cover as a dynamic-programming problem. Write the pseudocode of a dynamic-programming solution.
